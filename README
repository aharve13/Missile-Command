600.120.01 - Intermediate Programming
Assignment 9 - Interactive Showdown

Missile Command

=======================================
The win occurs when all incoming missiles are 
destroyed (there are 25 missiles). The loss 
occurs when all bases are destroyed (there are 3).

A win will not be achieved unless all 25 
missiles are destroyed - this can take some 
time as the missiles are generated randomly.

A loss will only be achieved if all bases are 
destroyed - cities are there for decoration, 
and maybe points in the next version.

The game starts immediately on the program run.

The game, once won or lost, must be quit and 
manually restarted.

The incoming missiles do not give off blasts, 
only the outgoing defensive missiles.

The bases are on each side and the middle, and 
the cities are in the spaces in-between.

The closest non-hit base will fire an outgoing 
missile. The outgoing missiles move faster than 
the incoming missiles. There is no ammo count.

The game currently runs at 10fps (every 100ms). 
It can run at faster rates, this is just an 
arbitrary fps choice.

The incoming missiles fire directly towards the 
middle of the cities and bases, and are considered 
as hitting the target when they reach the bottom of 
the screen (not the edge of the city or base).
